- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Systems** - Designing collaborative agent architectures
- 🎯 **LLM Fine-tuning & Alignment** - Making models actually useful
- 🧠 **Foundation Models** - Understanding and applying large-scale models
- 📊 **Self-supervised Learning** - Learning from unlabeled data
- 🔍 **RAG & Information Retrieval** - Building smarter search systems
- 🎵 **Audio & Speech Processing** - My research background in audio representation learning

## 🛠 Tech I Work With

**AI/ML**: PyTorch, Transformers, LangChain, LangGraph  
**Backend**: FastAPI, Node.js, TypeScript  
**Others**: PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS ECS

## 🎓 Background
