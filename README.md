- **Foundation Models** - Understanding and applying large-scale models
- **Self-supervised Learning** - Learning from unlabeled data
- **RAG & Information Retrieval** - Building smarter search systems
- **Audio & Speech Processing** - My research background in audio representation learning

## Background

- MS in Robotics @ Kwangwoon University (2020-2022)
  - Advisor: Prof. Yong-Hoon Choi
  - Research focus: Self-supervised Learning for Audio Representation
